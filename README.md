*Guys! [I am creating a video course for CL](https://www.udemy.com/course/common-lisp-programming/?referralCode=2F3D698BBC4326F94358), so you can learn it effectively, without hitting all the roadblocks that I encountered. It's on the Udemy platform. I can send a free link to my patrons, or if you are a student. Thanks!*

My hidden plan is to **make Common Lisp popular again**. For this I write on collaborative resources (I am a massive contributor of the [Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/)).
