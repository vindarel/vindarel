### Vindarel

*It's me! You can call me Vincent.*

I am a *full-stack developer*. My language of choice is now Common Lisp, far ahead Python (even though Python's tooling is still sometimes superior): see my article [Python VS Common Lisp, workflow and ecosystem](https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/pythonvslisp/). 

I write intensively about Common Lisp *on collaborative resources*. **My hidden plan is to make Common Lisp popular again**. For this, I contribute to the [Common Lisp Cookbook](https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/) (I am the main contributor, by far). I wrote about: CLOS, data structures, building executables, scripting, web scraping, debugging, error handling, testing, databases, GUI programming, web development, etc, and I added a theme, a sidebar and syntax highlighting. I also take time to maintain the [awesome-cl list](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl/), an important resource in my eyes. I dig up, reference and sort Common Lisp libraries (and I still discover hidden gems three years after). I do community stuff for [Lisp Advocates](https://www.reddit.com/r/lispadvocates/) (not the creator).

Now a newcomer has far more practical information for getting started that a few years ago. But there's still a lot to do, and I'd like to do more. You can thank me and encourage me by donations on the following platforms. As I currently don't have a fixed (nor big) income, that helps. Thanks!

I also write and maintain tools:

- [colisper](https://github.com/vindarel/colisper), an interface to Comby, for syntactic code checking and refactoring of Lisp code.

libraries:

- [cl-str](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str/), that fixed my first frustration with CL
- [replic](https://github.com/vindarel/replic/), to help create a readline application in no time
- [fuzzy-match](https://github.com/vindarel/fuzzy-match)
- [cl-readline](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-readline) (maintainer)

software:
 
 - [cl-torrents](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents), with an experimental [Weblocks front-end](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents-web)
 - [Abelujo](https://gitlab.com/vindarel/abelujo/), a free software for bookshops
 - [ABStock](https://github.com/vindarel/ABStock), a catalogue of books (and other products)
 - [OpenBookStore](https://github.com/OpenBookStore/openbookstore), a personal book manager, aiming to replace Abelujo
 
project skeletons and demos:
 
- [lisp-web-template-productlist](https://github.com/vindarel/lisp-web-template-productlist): Hunchentoot + easy-routes + Djula templates + Bulma CSS + a Makefile to build the project
- [lisp-web-live-reload-example](https://github.com/vindarel/lisp-web-live-reload-example): an example of how image-based development is useful. Learn to interact with a running website, including with a remote one with Swank.
 
I contribute to awesome projects such as:
 
- [Weblocks](https://github.com/40ants/weblocks/), an [isomorphic web framework](https://github.com/vindarel/awesome-no-js-web-frameworks). I helped write the quickstart, fixed HTML generation in tables, wrote more documentation, raised issues.
- the [Nyxt browser](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/): I was part of the team in 2019, I am the second contributor of that year.
 
and I fix bugs when I see them (Mito, Djula…).
 
I run Common Lisp in production©.
